title: FoldingText 2.0 Release
description: Improved editor, expanded syntax highlighting, new Software Development Kit.
---

I'm sorry this update took so long. FoldingText's been rewritten 2 or 3 times since the last release. It's been a long journey, but is back on track now.

Please treat 2.0 as a new app. Explore the menu's, browse the documentation. Give it all another try. Changes are everywhere, here are a few of the big ones:

- Much improved editor. FoldingText now uses the open source CodeMirror editor component and is much more stable.

- Expanded syntax highlighting. Markdown, GitHub Markdown, CriticMarkup, and large parts of MultiMarkdown.

- New Software Development Kit. The API's are now documented, more powerful, and easier to debug.
