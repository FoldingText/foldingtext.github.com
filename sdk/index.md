---

Use FoldingText's software development kit (SDK) to create scripts, themes, and plugins.

## Getting Started

You can extend FoldingText in three ways:

1. [Create scripts](scripts) to automate FoldingText and integrate with other AppleScript enabled apps.

2. [Create themes](themes) to change colors, fonts, and other aspects of how FoldingText looks.

3. [Create plugins](plugins) to integrate directly with FoldingText's code and add new features.
