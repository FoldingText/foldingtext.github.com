title: FoldingText SDK (FoldingText 1.3 Dev Only)
---

Use FoldingText's software development kit (SDK) to create scripts, themes, and plugins.

## Getting Started

You can extend FoldingText in three ways:

1. Use [AppleScript](scripts) to automate FoldingText and integrate with other AppleScript enabled apps.

2. Use [CSS/LESS](themes) to create FoldingText themes. Change colors, fonts, and other aspects of how FoldingText looks.

3. Use [JavaScript plugins](plugins) to integrate directly with FoldingText's code and add new features.
