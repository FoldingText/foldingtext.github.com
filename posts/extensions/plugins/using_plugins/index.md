This page contains some tips for using [FoldingText plugins](/posts/extensions/plugins).

To install a plugin:

1. Use the _File > Open Application Folder_ menu item and then locate the Plug-Ins folder.
2. Copy the plugin (folder ending with .ftplugin) into the Plug-Ins folder.
4. You can verify that a plugin is installed by opening the _FoldingText > Plugin Manager_ menu item.

Often plugins will add new commands that are accessible through _Edit > Run Command_. But you should read the plugin documentation to learn exactly how to use it.

If you would like to create your own plugin please see FoldingText's _Help > Software Development Kit_ menu item.
