This page contains some tips for using [FoldingText plugins](/posts/extensions/plugins).

To install a plugin:

1. Use File > Open Plugins Folder to open the plugins folder.
2. Copy the plugin into that plugins folder.
3. The plugin should now get loaded into any new document that you create. You will need to close an reopen any existing documents to have the plugin loaded into them.

Often plugins will add new commands that are accessible through View > Command Mode. But you should read the plugin documentation to learn exactly how to use it.

If you would like to create your own plugin please read "Plugin API Documentation" which you can find through FoldingText's Help > Plugin API Documentation menu item.
