This plugin is useful if you are trying to hit a specific word or character count when writing your document. After installing the plugin you can display your word count by:

1. Enter Command Mode (View > Command Mode)
2. Type the "word count" command to show the live counts.
3. Type the "word count" command again to remove the counts.

The word count plugin is availible (along with others) from FoldingText's plugin collection.
