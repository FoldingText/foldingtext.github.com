{{page.description}}

An applescript which automatically expands the top N levels of the FoldingText Outline, and leaves the lower levels concealed by folding.

![User dialog](https://raw.github.com/RobTrew/tree-tools/master/FoldingText%20scripts/Expand%20collapse/Expand-to-level-N.png)

A dialog tells the user how many levels there are in the current outline, and invite the user to enter a number.

- Entering 1 (or less) will completely collapse the outline, folding all the Level 1 lines, leaving the rest concealed.
- Entering a large number (the maximum number of levels, or more) will completely expand the outline, leaving no lines folded.
- Entering a number between 1 and the maximum depth will leave the outline consistently folded at a particular level
- Entering a number with a sign (e.g. +1 -1) will increase or decrease the current degree of folding.
