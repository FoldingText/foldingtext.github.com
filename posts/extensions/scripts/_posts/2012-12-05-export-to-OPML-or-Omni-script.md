{{page.description}}

An applescript which exports the line selected in FoldingText, with all of its descendants, to an OPML file, or to any Omni applications which are installed on the system.

The list of export choices offered by the script will depend on which, if any, Omni apps are installed, and may include OmniOutliner, OmniFocus, and OmniGraffle as well as the default OPML.

![User dialog](https://raw.github.com/RobTrew/tree-tools/master/FoldingText%20scripts/Import%20Export/FT2Omni-or-OPML.png)

- If OPML is chosen, a File Save dialog will appear.
- If an Omni app is chosen, the application will be launched, if necessary, and the output will take the form of a new (unsaved) Omni app document.
