title: Create or Deepen Header Level Script
description: Assign this script to a keystroke to simplify marking lines as headers
---

{{page.description}}

Applescript giving a single keystroke route to either marking the selected line as a header (the cursor can be anywhere in the line) or deepening its header level (adding a further hash).

Saves the keystrokes involved in:

- Moving to the start of the line,
- deleting any existing list or other formatting
- typing a #

(repeated keystrokes/runs will deepen the heading level).
