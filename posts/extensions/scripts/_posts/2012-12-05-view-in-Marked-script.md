{{page.description}}

Applescript which launches Marked and opens the current FoldingText document in it.

( Alerts the user if the FT document has not yet been saved )

By default, the script tries to place the Marked and FoldingText versions side by side, each occupying half of the screen.
If this is not your preferred behaviour, or does not suit your display setup, you can adjust the behaviour of the script by editing the value of a property in its opening lines from *true* to *false*.

*property pblnPositionWindows : false*
