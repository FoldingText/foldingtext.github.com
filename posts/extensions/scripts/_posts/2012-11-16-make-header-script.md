description: Use this script to simplify marking lines as headers, and increasing header indentation level.

{{page.description}}

This script makes it easy to quickly mark a line as a heading. It automates moving to the start of the line, deleting any existing list or other formatting, and then typing a `#`. If you run it on a line that's already a heading it will increase the heading level by inserting an additional `#` at the start of the line.

This script is most useful if you [assign a keyboard shortcut](./using_scripts/) to it, then you can make a header in a single keystroke.
